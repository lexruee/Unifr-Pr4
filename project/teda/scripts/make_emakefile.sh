# Note 1: the compiler option no_line_info is to make object code created by a
# R16 compiler compatible with a R13 virtual machine. It avoids that the object
# code contains the opcode 153 which is not known by R13 VMs.
# This is just a workaround due to our specific settings (Erlang R13 on DIUF
# Linux machines and Erlang R16 on most personal machines), and it can be
# adapted for different settings.

# Note 2: this Emakefile is supposed to be used by every Erlang TEDA app. It
# means, compile everything in the current directory, and everything in the
# lib directory. That's basically everything that a TEDA app needs to run.
